# üìçIntroduction

Hey there!

Have you heard of GitHub? It's a version control system that is super popular among developers. If you're interested in collaborating on open-source projects, then knowing how to use GitHub is a must-have skill!

Whether you're a web developer, mobile developer, or cloud enthusiast, having a strong understanding of GitHub CLI can be incredibly helpful in your career. So why not work on building a solid GitHub profile and start learning how to use GitHub CLI today? It could be the boost you need to take your career to the next level!

# üìçUnderstanding GitHub and Git

GitHub and Git are essential tools for developers to manage and maintain their codebase. Git is a version control system that helps developers to keep track of changes made to their code locally and remotely. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate on open-source projects and share code with others.

While GitHub has an easy-to-use UI, mastering Git requires some learning curve. However, once you learn Git, it can take your career to new heights. Git provides a powerful way to handle the GitHub repository and source code faster and in a reliable manner. Therefore, having a good understanding of Git and a strong GitHub profile can be incredibly beneficial for developers, regardless of their specialty, be it web development, mobile development, or cloud computing üöÄ

### **üìçWhat's Git & Github?**

Git: Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is widely used by developers all around the world to manage large and small-scale projects. Since it is an open-source project it is free to use. It helps us to keep track of every modification in our project. Git has been used by various organizations, businesses, professionals, and even startups to manage their code, task allocation, and project management.

Github: GitHub is one of the most advanced development platforms in the world. It has several useful features that enable development teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions. Github is just a cloud-based hosting service that let you manage Git. There are many applications like Github like GitLab or BitBucket.

# **üìçPrerequisites for Practicing Git Commands**

## **1\. Basic knowledge of the command-line interface (CLI)**

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool used for interacting with the computer's operating system. Git is primarily used via the command line, so having a basic understanding of how to navigate and use the command line is essential.

## **2\. Setting up a Git environment**

To practice Git commands, you'll need to have a Git environment set up on your computer. This involves installing Git and setting up a Git repository. There are many online resources available to help you install Git, including step-by-step guides for different operating systems.

You can install Git CLI on your laptop and practice the below cheat sheet command.
