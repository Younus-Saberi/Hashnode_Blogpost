# Advanced Command Used in Git and GitHub

As a developer, Git and GitHub are two essential tools that you use frequently. Git is a version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development while GitHub is a web-based repository hosting service that uses Git for version control. While learning the basics of Git and GitHub is vital, understanding advanced commands will take your skills to the next level. In this article, we will explore several advanced Git and GitHub commands you need to know.

In my previous blog, I have discussed the difference between Git and GitHub. Also made an introductory cheatsheet command for the Git CLI, Do check it the blog out [here](https://blog.younussaberi.me/github-beginner-cheatsheet).

Let's start with the blog with the commands divide into different categories.

> Knowing advanced commands can be helpful when working on a project with a team, as they can come in handy in certain situations. Therefore, it's a good idea to familiarize oneself with these commands and understand when they are appropriate to use.

# 1.üìçCommonly Used Advanced Git Commands

#### A. `git diff`

The `git diff` the command is used to compare two different versions of the same file. For instance, you may want to compare the changes between your working directory and a commit. The `git diff` command is also useful in reviewing changes made by other team members. The following is an example of how to use the `git diff` command:

```bash
git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>
```

#### B. `git stash`

The `git stash` the command is used to save changes temporarily. Sometimes you may want to switch to another branch, but you're not ready to commit the current changes. In such cases, you can use `git stash` to save the changes temporarily, switch to another branch, and restore the changes later. The following is how to use `git stash` command:

```bash
git stash
```

#### C. `git rebase`

The `git rebase` command is used to merge changes from one branch to another branch while maintaining a linear history. You can use `git rebase` to pull upstream changes from a remote repository before pushing your changes. It's always recommended to use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` to keep your history clean. The following is an example of how to use the `git rebase` command:

```bash
git checkout target_branch
git rebase source_branch
```

#### D. `git cherry-pick`

The `git cherry-pick` command is used to apply commit changes of another branch to the current branch. It's useful when you want to apply a specific fix or feature from another branch. The following is an example of how to use `git cherry-pick` command:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

#### E. `git bisect`

The `git bisect` command is used when there's a need to locate which commit caused a bug. It's a binary search algorithm that helps you identify the offending commits. The following is an example of how to use the `git bisect` command:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad <commit-hash>
git bisect good <commit-hash>
```

# 2\. üìçAdvanced GitHub commands

#### A. `git submodule`

The `git submodule` command is used to manage code libraries used in a GitHub repository. Submodules help you manage other programs or libraries as separate projects inside your repository. The following is an example of how to use `git submodule` command:

```bash
git submodule add <repository>
```

#### B. `git amend`

The `git amend` command is used when you want to modify the latest commit. For instance, you can use `git amend` to modify your commit message or add missing changes to the latest commit. The following example demonstrates how to use `git amend` command:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

#### C. `git reflog`

The `git reflog` command is used to identify lost commits. It records all the changes that happen to the Git repository, even if some commits are removed. The following is an example of how to use the `git reflog` command:

```bash
git reflog
```

#### D. `git blame`

The `git blame` command is used to track changes to a file. The command shows every line of code, with the name of the developer who last edited it and the commit message. It's useful in understanding who changed code and why. The following is an example of how to use the `git blame` command:

```bash
git blame <filename>
```

# 3\. üìçBest Practices for Using Advanced Git Commands and GitHub

#### A. Proper Usage of Advanced Commands

Although advanced Git commands and GitHub commands are useful, misusing them can result in serious consequences. Before using advanced commands, ensure that you understand them, and only use them when it's necessary.

#### B. Understanding the Risks of Advanced Commands

Advanced Git commands and GitHub commands come with risks such as corrupting repositories or losing commits. Ensure that you're aware of the risks, and you're comfortable with the possibility of losing data.

#### C. Creating Backups and Restoring Commits

Always create backups of your repositories before running commands that could cause data loss. In case something goes wrong, you can restore the lost commits.

#### D. Always Reading the Documentation

Ensure that you regularly read Git and GitHub documentation, especially when using advanced commands. The documentation is always updated as new features are released.

# 4\. üìçBonus Section ‚ú®

Above mentioned commands such as rebase, stash, and diff come in handy when you face the "Merge Conflict Problem". Below is an real-life example i have face for merge conflict and how you can avoid it and most importantly resolve it

### What is Merge Conflict ü§î???  

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/05/image-45.png align="center")

Merge conflict is a common occurrence when working collaboratively on a codebase. It happens when two or more people modify the same part of a file, resulting in conflicting changes that Git can't automatically resolve.

Resolving merge conflicts can be intimidating, but it's not as complicated as it sounds. The first step is to identify the conflicts and understand the changes made by each person. Once you know what's causing the conflict, you can make a decision on which changes to keep and which to discard.

To resolve the conflict, you can use a merge tool like the vs code supports inbuilt merge tool, or you can manually edit the files in question to remove the conflicting lines. Once the conflict is resolved, you can commit the changes and push them to the repository.

The key to successfully resolving merge conflicts is clear communication and collaboration with your team. By staying in sync and communicating about changes, you can minimize the chances of conflicts arising in the first place.

At last, cheatsheet are a great way to revise concepts and will always help for quick reference in future
